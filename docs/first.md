# Elephants

Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised:

- **African bush elephant** (*Loxodonta africana*)
- **African forest elephant** (*Loxodonta cyclotis*)
- **Asian elephant** (*Elephas maximus*)

They are the only surviving members of the family **Elephantidae** and the order **Proboscidea**. Extinct relatives include **mammoths** and **mastodons**.

## Distinctive Features

Elephants have several unique physical characteristics:

- A long proboscis called a **trunk**
- **Tusks**
- Large **ear flaps**
- **Pillar-like legs**
- Tough but sensitive **grey skin**

### Trunk
The trunk is prehensile and is used for:
- Bringing food and water to the mouth
- Grasping and manipulating objects

### Tusks
Tusks are derived from the incisor teeth and serve as:
- Weapons
- Tools for moving objects
- Tools for digging

### Ears
The large ear flaps help with:
- Maintaining body temperature
- Communication
